# MoReBikeS: Model Reuse with Bike rental Station data 
Adaptive reuse of learnt knowledge is of critical importance in the majority of knowledge-intensive application areas, particularly when the context in which the learnt model operates can be expected to vary from training to deployment. This challenge therefore focuses on model reuse and context change.  The challenge is carried out in the framework of historical bicycle rental data obtained from Valencia, Spain. Bicycles are continuously taken from and returned to rental stations across the city. The data consists of hourly availability of bikes at each station; information on weather and (local) holidays. The challenge motivation is based on the fact that, while we may have had the opportunity to learn and tune good models for old stations with historical data, we do not always have the same amount of data for new stations. The task will be to make predictions (3 hours ahead) with regard to the number of bikes available for these new stations and within the next months. This situation fluctuates considerably depending on the time of year, the station's location, etc. The key point here is that by using models from other stations that have been learnt from data spanning more than two years, better predictions can be made for the new stations. In the end, this challenge aims at promoting the reusability of models rather than retraining a different model again and again each time the context changes.

## Task Description  
  The task in this challenge is to predict the number of available bikes in every bike rental stations 3 hours in advance. There are at least two use cases for such predictions. First, a user plans to rent (or return) a bike in 3 hours time and wants to choose a bike station which is not empty (or full). Second, the company wants to avoid situations where a station is empty or full and therefore needs to move bikes between stations. For this purpose they need to know which stations are more likely to be empty or full soon. In both these cases the prediction can be based on what time of the day, week, or year it is and what the weather conditions are. Also, information about the current status in the station can be used. A successful predictor needs to take into account all of these aspects, as well as the profile of bike availability in this station, learned from historical information. The quality of predictions can be better, when more historical information is available. In this challenge, I explore a setting where there are 200 stations which have been running for more than 2 years and 75 stations which have just been open for a month. The task is to reuse the models learned on 200 "old" stations in order to improve prediction performance on the 75 "new" stations. Hence, this challenge evaluates prediction performance on the 75 stations. The final leaderboard results are as follows...
