The task in this challenge is to predict the number of available bikes in every bike rental stations 3 hours in advance. There are at least two use cases for such predictions. First, a user plans to rent (or return) a bike in 3 hours time and wants to choose a bike station which is not empty (or full). Second, the company wants to avoid situations where a station is empty or full and therefore needs to move bikes between stations. For this purpose they need to know which stations are more likely to be empty or full soon. In both these cases the prediction can be based on what time of the day, week, or year it is and what the weather conditions are. Also, information about the current status in the station can be used. A successful predictor needs to take into account all of these aspects, as well as the profile of bike availability in this station, learned from historical information. The quality of predictions can be the better the more historical information is available. In this challenge we explore a setting where there are 200 stations which have been running for more than 2 years and 75 stations which have just been open for a month. The task is to reuse the models learned on 200 "old" stations in order to improve prediction performance on the 75 "new" stations. Hence, this challenge evaluates prediction performance on the 75 stations. If we would give full historical data about the 200 stations then we would be evaluating model building and model reuse performance at the same time. Therefore, we have decided to build models ourselves and provide the models without the full data that they have been trained on. Still, full training data for 10 stations is provided in order to facilitate the analysis about how a model can be reused in other stations and in later times. For the rest of the 190 training stations we provide only data for one month, also to help in deciding how the models can be reused.
